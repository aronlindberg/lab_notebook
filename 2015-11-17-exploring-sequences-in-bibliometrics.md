# Exploring sequences in bibliometrics
I'm still intrigued by the idea of exploring whether specific sequences of theorizing or empirival evidencing yields high amounts of citations. One way of doing it would be to use Klarner & Raisch (2013) and look at the editorials of various journals to identify patterns of change. But how would you control for the quality of the journal? Don't know.
