# A New Wiki Approach
Instead of just writing a set of disorganized reflection notes, I am now starting to organize my lab notes as a git-based Gollum wiki. The key is to organize it as a) a set of high-level topics (research problems, arguments, papers) that contain links to b) research units. Research units are things like:

* Notes from reading individual articles or books
* Literature review tables
* Scripts or functions
* Ideas or reflections
* Outlines
* Arguments

In many ways there is no difference between what I'm actually doing right now, this is just a scheme for a) organizing notes into categories, and b) establishing links between  different notes
