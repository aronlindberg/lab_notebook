# A New Wiki Approach
Instead of just writing a set of disorganized reflection notes, I am now starting to organize my lab notes as a git-based Gollum wiki. The key is to organize it as a) a set of high-level topics (research problems, arguments, papers) that contain links to b) research units. Research units are things like:

* Notes from reading individual articles or books
* Literature review tables
* Scripts or functions
* Ideas or reflections
* Outlines
* Arguments
* Reading lists

In many ways there is no difference between what I'm actually doing right now, this is just a scheme for a) organizing notes into categories, and b) establishing links between different notes. A major difference involves putting in tabs in books and then going through them and writing notes after (or during) reading. It could be helpful to have two bookmarks - one for reading and one for note-taking. Taking notes while reading interferes too much.

The idea is to continuously create these research units that can be recombined in various ways to build up the papers that I'm writing. The key to making this happen is to 1) truly take down notes on all reading, both articles and books), 2) create a code infrastructure that allows me to express computational ideas in short scripts, 3) put the reading lists and tech_skills documents in the wiki
