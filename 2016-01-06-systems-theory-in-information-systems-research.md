# Systems Theory in Information Systems Research
* Inductive methods cannot deal with systems phenomena, since emergence amounts to more than the the sum of its parts
* Maturana, Bertallanfy, Niklas Luhman - key readings in systems theory
* Most systems problems cannot be solved analytically (i.e. deriving a single, absolute solution), but need simulation
* Ironically, information systems have ignored systems - probably because regression modeling with available data has allowed us to at least partially say something useful about some problems.
* Philosophical perspectives, no matter how appropriate on a conceptual level, need to be complemented with types of data and analytical methods in order to actually become useful within a specific field of research
* How can systems theory be applied methodologically?
* How is this different from agent-based modeling (complex adaptive systems)
