# Reading Practices
My reading practice seems to be quite solid in terms of readings books and audiobooks. Where it is less solid is in making notes and reading articles. Here are a couple of suggestions to change that situation:

* Stop borrowing books from the library. It is key that you actually buy the books, so that you can insert stickers and write marginalia.
* While much article reading is specific to certain articles, it could be helpful to conduct an annual review of what has been published in the previous year. I suggest that you do this every January, as a start to the new year. The review can center on a number of journals which you scan for articles of interest:
  - MISQ
  - ISR
  - JMIS
  - JAIS
  - Org Sci
  - Man Sci
  - AMJ
  - AMR
  - ASQ
That's 9 journals, times perhaps 4 issues each year, totaling 36 issues. I'll scan each of these, and then I'll take anything (articles AND editorials) that seems interesting, save the PDFs, organize them per themes, and then print them as a kind of book that I can read. In order to find the right articles, I should apply a "filter". Here are a number of suggested "filters":
  - Innovation
  - Openness
  - Coordination
  - Creativity
  - Distributed Cognition
  - Intelligence
  - Learning
  - Mixed Methods
  - Pragmatism
  - Actor-Network Theory
  - Theorizing
  - Publishing
