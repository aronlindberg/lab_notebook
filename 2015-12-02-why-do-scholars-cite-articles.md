# Why do scholars cite articles?
Here is a brainstorm of why articles are cited:
* A framework helps to discern certain constructs
* A construct is well-defined
* Arguments or evidence for the direction (and substantive/statistical significance) of a relationship

It might be the case that articles which are largely exploitative in their structure do provide good evidence for the relationships between constructs, and therefore are cited in that way. Exploitative articles with low amounts of citations should, based on this logic, then only provide evidence of relationships that could have been inferred from the literature the article borrows from. It's contribution therefore, does not expand on previous research, and will not be cited - other scholars might as well cite the original article and ask readers to make a minor intellectual leap of faith (i.e. switching contexts). Hence, there should be a conceptual evaluation scale and an empirical evaluation scale:

(a) Newness of constructs or hypothesized relationships (newness assumes construct or relationship has not been conceptualized or theorized previously
(b) Newness of evidence with regards to relationships (newness assumes evidence has not been shown earlier)

The first, (a) is often used by those who want to test hypotheses with regards to new relationships between known constructs or to connect a known construct to an unknown construct (and can then use a citation that suggests a certain relationship). (b) is often used either as a background to argue against, or as a way to ground parts of your model in known relationship to build a platform that you can extend through new relationships.
