# Entropy, Complexity, & Heterogeneity
It is quite possible that I need all three of these measures since they are capturing different things. Here are some brief definitions:

* Entropy captures the variation in activity types in a single routine enactment
* Complexity captures the variation in ordering of activity types in a single routine enactment
* Heterogeneity captures the variation of activity types *and* their ordering across a routine (i.e. multiple routine enactments, or the latent structure of the routine)

In that sense, heterogeneity is an overarching concept that captures both entropy and complexity but at the routine-level, not the routine enactment level.
