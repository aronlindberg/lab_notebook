# Experiments on open innovation sequences
* Research on creativity and innovation has largely focused on personality dispositions as well as group compositions
* Emerging research is starting to look to the characteristics of the creative process itself - the temporally distributed actions and their ordering, rhythm, and variety.
* Extant theory suggests that highly entropic sequences may provide efficient coverage of necessary activities, thus leading to higher rates of task completion. Simultaneously, other results points towards the positive effects of sequential variation or longitudinal turbulence. This tends to indicate complex discursive processes necessary to deal with discrepant mental models.
* Hence, we would expect entropic sequences to lead to successful task completion in relatively unambiguous situations, whereas complex sequences lead to successful task completion in ambiguous situations.
* To test these hypotheses, we intend to design a set of experiments using Mechanical Turk (MTurk). A specific creative or collaborative task will be designed, which will then be placed in an experimental environment on Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Then the experiment will be run hundreds of times, so as to collect large samples of activity sequences perform under varying conditions with varying degrees of successful task completion
* These results help us to validate loose assertions made with regards to specific sequence characteristics and their relationship to task completion (or innovative/creative outcomes?)
* Validating these relationships would have important implications for the study of creativity and innovation, since it helps shift the focus from group composition and individual variables, towards characteristics of the process itself. This is a powerful shift of focus, since the process can often be manipulated, while individual personality traits or group composition factors often are stickier and harder to change.
