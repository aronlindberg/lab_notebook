# Reading Strategy II

Here's Jaccard & Jacoby's list of topics:

"
1. *Creativity:* Read current literatures on creativity that may give you new thinking strategies.
2. *Psychometrics:* Read literatures in psychometrics that help you define and think about constructs in general as well as in your substantive areas of study.
3. *Philosophy of science:* Read the classics in philosophy of science as well as more current-day perspectives on science from the perspective of philosophers.
4. *Causality and causal modeling:* Read literature on statistical, methodological, conceptual, and philosophical issues on causality in general as well as moderation, mediation, spuriousness, reciprocal causality, longitudinal modeling, and latent variables, in particular.
5. *Simulation methods:* Read about simulation methodology, especially as it applies to emerging technologies.
6. *Mathematical modeling:* In addition to mathematical modeling in general, read literatures on chaos theory and catastrophe theory.
7. *Grounded/emergent theory construction:* Read literature on strategies for con- structing grounded theories and qualitative data analysis.
8. *Rhetoric and communication theory:* Read literature on methods of argumenta- tion, logic, and theories and methods of debate.
9. *Cognitive biases and limitations of information processing:* This literature tends to appear mostly in cognitive psychology, social psychology, consumer behavior, and decision making. It will help keep you attuned to biases that can enter into your thinking.
10. *Historical methodology.* For research involving analysis of primary sources and archival materials, staying abreast of good historical methodological practices is important.
11. *General systems of thought:* Touch base with the literatures on all of the topics discussed in Chapter 11. These include neural networks, stage theories, reinforcement theories, humanism and positive psychology, symbolic interactionism, systems theory, materialism, structuralism, functionalism, postmodernism, and evolutionary perspectives.
12. *Statistics:* Keep abreast of recent developments in probability theory, exploratory statistical methods, structural equation modeling, nonlinear modeling, multilevel modeling, and longitudinal methods.
13. *Scientific and nonscientific writing techniques and presentation strategies:* Strive to find more effective ways of presenting your theories.

This is quite an extensive list, and I probably need to decide on a smaller number of topics to focus on. What I like about it is that it doesn't focus on 'theorizing' per se, but rather pulls out it's constituent components as separate topics.
