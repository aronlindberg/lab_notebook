# Scripting templates
To make the work for research assistants within the lab easier I need to provide a number of templates for standard tasks. This would involve things such as:

* Code Style Guide (Hadley Wickham's)
* Loading/installing packages in a unitary way
* Storing credentials in a safe way
* Folder structures (R/data/analysis/output)
* Visualization templates (ggplot2/ggvis)
* Figure templates (TikZ)
* Knitr templates
