# Writing discussion sections is Hard
It still seems that writing discussion sections is like black magic to me. It's an ambiguous task that I don't quite know how to take on. Having said that, I went through a structured process of learning to write introductions which frame a problem in an interesting way, and that has definitely been an intellectual growth process. This indicates to me that I should be able to do something similar with regards to discussion sections too. Part of the challenge is that here we get to the more 'artistic', messy part of making a theoretical contribution. For understanding the frontend there is quite a bit of material to help scholars understand how to stage a contribution. This work mainly involves criticizing the literature, and we have a fair amount of explicitly formulated tools for doing that. Doing the same thing for discussion sections is more difficult, because this is where the actual theoretical contribution should be articulated.

There are a couple of ways of approaching this. The first is to create a very high-level template:

1. Restate research problem
2. Restate RQs
3. Summarize findings
4. Explain theoretical, methodological, and practical implications
5. Explain Future Research
6. Conclude

Here, it is naturally step (4) that is causing the major issues. In order to get around this I suggest that I conduct a miniature grounded theory project where I read a discussion section every night and take notes. This will enable me to discern generic patterns in how accomplished scholars publishing in good journals actually write these sections.

The project will be run in the following way: every evening I will read one discussion section focused on the theoretical contributions. This means reading from the point where conceptualization is finished to the end of the paper, excluding practical contributions. Future research and conclusion sections may be of value, as they often summarize theoretical contributions. I will code these in Atlas.TI, and write memos in order to distill insights. The idea is to generate a conceptual framework of the various ways in which scholars articulate research contributions in journals such as MISQ, ISR, Organization Science, Management Science, Academy of Management Journal, ASQ, etc.

I've already noted a certain flow in the two articles that I have read so far:

1. Articulate research problem
2. Explain and praise previous contributions
3. Sort out contributions which are inapplicable to current case
4. Show work that is "more in the vein" of the current work
5. Explain how such work is extended by current work
6. Suggest a new way of seeing the research problem/phenomena
7. Articulate what further inquiry should be done to strengthen/further explore this view
8. Articulate practical contributions (this provides a sense of grounding which is important for increasing confidence in, and credibility of, contributions)
