Hi All,

I've received several high-quality questions, which highlight issues that are helpful for the class as a whole to reflect on and discuss. Below I'll discuss each of these issues.

# 1. I'm stuck! What do I do?
Many of the things you are being asked to do are variations of what you have been taught before. However, that means that the exact task often has not been encountered before, and this is where the templates that we (the faculty) have given you, start to fall apart. This is obviously frustrating. However, it is a necessary part of our journey. Pierce (1980: 127) writes:

"Novices in mathematics, science, or engineering are forever demanding infallible, universal, mechanical methods for solving problems. Such methods are valuable in proving that problems can be solved, but in the case of difficult problems they are seldom practical, and they may sometimes be completely unfeasible...The person who isn't a novice thinks hard about a specific problem in order to see if there isn't some better approach than a machine-like application of what he has been taught."

Currently, you are in a stage of transition between being novices and not-novices. How does one then manage this situation? My advice is this: remember that what we are engaging in is essentially rhetoric. We are trying to convince the readers of our papers that certain relationships between some set of well-measured constructs hold. The statistics that we are extracting from the data are intended to support us in convincing the reader.

Statistics is not mathematics. Rather, it is filled with grey areas, compromises, and conflicting pieces of evidence. What are we then to do? We remember our goal (what we want to convince the reader of) and then we use the available evidence to support that claim as best as possible. Often this means extracting multiple pieces of statistical evidence that has the least awkward fit with the claim that you are making. Most of them need to support your argument, but it is unlikely that every single piece of empirical evidence that you extract using your statistical tools will support your claim unequivocally. So we grab what evidence we can, and we try to piece it together into the best argument, with the best possible set of supporting facts. Weick (2004, attached) speaks of this situation as a situation of thrownness (we are being thrown into a situation with idiosyncratic facts), and our only counter is to engage in bricolage (putting together the best possible set of empirical evidence for the point that we are trying to argue). Sometimes this means scaling back (e.g. maybe we can't claim full measurement invariance, but maybe we can claim partial measurement invariance?).

Further, the literature is your friend. When there is something you don't understand, go to Hair, Byrne, or Hayes. Survey the table of contents to see if any of the sections may apply to the problem that you are facing. If answers do not seem to be available in the book, you may at least have been able to garner some key words. Searching for those keywords at scholar.google.com will often yield some interesting cites which may suggest other approaches.

Last, we need to approach this as a collective. The questions I have received so far have been well-considered and important. I appreciate your thoughtfulness. Going forward, let's try our best to send questions to the mailing list, as opposed to only me and Yunmei. Others probably have the same concerns, and together you may be able to piece together a solution. Most importantly, struggling through a problem together with your colleagues is exactly what collaborative research is about. In that sense I want this course to be a microcosm of a real research situation, as opposed to a process by which knowledge is transferred from instructors to students. Maybe this is a good point to start those Webex sessions we discussed?

# 2. How can I conduct a test for measurement invariance when sd2 is missing from one of the datasets?
Because sd2 is missing from the insurance sample, we cannot test that particular item for invariance. However, we can still test the other two items measuring self-determination, as well as the rest of the factor structure. Given the data that we have, this is the best we can do. As stated above, we are being thrown into a situation, and we are required to engage in bricolage and make the best of the data that we have.

# 3. How do I test for invariance of a second-order factor structure?
The principles for testing a second-order factor structure for invariance are more or less the same as testing a first-order factor structure. Take the principles (not the mechanical steps!) that you have learnt and apply them. The slides from the summer residency do provide some hints as to how to do this. The Byrne book also discusses this in quite some detail if I remember correctly.

# 4. How can I put together the nomological net when I only have data for the four components of empowerment, as opposed to for the construct itself.
I'll offer a few hints here. First, remember how Spreitzer defines empowerment (hypothesis 1a-b). Second, covarying error terms indicates common sources of variance. This can be used to your advantage when modeling empowerment. Third, retaining the four components of empowerment may help you get more fine-grained insights than simply replacing it wholesale by a common empowerment factor.

Best,
Aron
