# Crowd sourcing and Collective Intelligence

* There is a wealth of different 'crowd'-related activities
  - funding
  - crowd-support
  - gamified crowds (e.g. citizen science)
* Engineered vs. organic collaboration - an interesting distinction is between intent/abuse, signal/noise - where crowd research actually is more focused on abuse and noise - the organic interactions which are uncontrolled and sometimes unintended from the perspective of the designer or engineer.
* Examples:
  - Amara.org - translating TED-talks to make them accessible
  - LeadGenius - generating sales leads
  - Universal Human Relevance System - Microsoft's internal microwork platform - all the major tech companies have their own internal microwork platforms
* Forums create subcommunities - so there are relationships between formal structuring mechanisms and organic structure - it is not either/or.
* Network position is positively correlated with speed/chance of finding HITs (Human Intelligence Tasks)
* Workers form work environments and support each other, even if they are not working together on individual HITs. Mentorship can be observed in these communities.
* Crowd-workers collaborate extensively in an 'ambient' sense (talking about the work on forums, sharing experiences, mentoring, giving advice on good/bad HITs)
* Implies that facilitating discourse is central to the future evolution of these platforms - it's not just about individual tasks!
* Crowd sourcing is just another method
* Study-class Method: You need a bunch of TAs who take notes
