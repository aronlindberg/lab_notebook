# Coordinative complexity
If discourse-driven problem-solving routines do not solve large amounts of technical problems (i.e. through merging code attached to pull requests), and if complexity in fact is negatively related to code merging. Then what is their purpose? I'm convinced developers do not engage in these behaviors for kicks and giggles, but that their participation is purposeful. Here is a working hypothesis: These are routines where developers generate requisite variety to deal with coordinative complexity - interdependencies between distributed sets of knowledge, understanding, as well as idiosyncratically varying technical platforms upon which their work is conducted. Thus, the fact that these represents long conversations that only lead to merging of code in roughly 15% of the cases, combined with the discursive nature of these activity sequences could indicate that they are actually there to create a coherent discourse - meaning a set of appropriate words, speech acts and technical configurations that developers need to use in order to make meaningful contributions to the project.
