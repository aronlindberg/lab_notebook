# My research program
Based on my 3-year plan it seems that I have three foci: digital (open) innovation, machine intelligence, and method. Here I think it's important to have clear biases in each of these areas. The digital innovation focus needs to be biased towards designers and open practices. The machine intelligence focus should be biased towards design & innovation. And the methods track should be biased towards supporting the research I'm already doing. In this sense, I have a program which is essentially focused on open innovation, but that recognizes the novel methods and approaches I'm using, as well as the observation that machine intelligence increasingly is becoming part of design work as well as contemporary socio-technical systems.

In addition there are a number of subthemes: distributed cognition, temporality, routines, process, narrative, computational-qualitative research, experiments, exploration/exploitation, and open business models.

It is absolutely key to make these foci reinforce each other. What can I do to establish such linkages? Here are a couple of ideas:

* Make sure all reading contributes to the foci - never read anything outside. It's already a wide scope.
* Increase speed of "data programming"
* Move algorithmic agency project towards design
* Gear business model work towards open business models
* Meditate & workout to speed up mental connections
