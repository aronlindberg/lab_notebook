# Contribution moves in discussion sections
Based on my reading of discussion sections I have recognized the following common 'moves' or
'patterns':

* *Suggesting:* Drawing out consequences from findings which may indicate potential hypotheses to test.
* *Shifting attention:* Showing how a new set of variables, relationships, or mechanisms needs to be focused on to better predict an outcome or understand a phenomena.
* *Reconciling tensions:* Showing how new findings help to reconcile the tensions between specific theories (which previously were in conflict), through showing how they are both correct under differing circumstances, or how they get specific parts of a causal process or generative mechanism right.
* *Contradicting:* Showing that extant theorizing simply is incorrect, or more often, incomplete, or limited by specific boundary conditions.
* *Exposing latent factors:* Indicating how specific findings are simply surface-level expressions of a deeper, often latent construct, process, or relationship.
* *Completing accounts:* Adding necessary pieces to a previously theorized account to make it's coverage more complete. E.g. adding additional predictors to a regression model.
* *Explaining mechanisms:* Taking a previously well-documented relationship and showing the process that generates it (through providing a generative mechanism or statistical mediator)
* *Contextualizing:* Providing moderators to show how relationship or mechanisms appear differently under different conditions or in varying contexts.
* *Exposing assumptions:* Indicating how previous, latently held assumptions are inconsistent with the findings of the new study. This then leads to a discrediting of previous theorizing and the crafting of a contribution space for the new theory.
* *Future research:* Indicating future research that becomes possible because of the contributions made in the article. This is distinct from the standard "future research section", which includes future research that always was possible.
* *Filling a gap:* Showing how a phenomena that previously had not been investigated, now has been investigated. N.B. This should only be used if there are specific reasons (inadequate extant conceptual frameworks or lacking methods) for why a demonstrably important area of research has been ignored.
