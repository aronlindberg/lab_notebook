# Reading Strategy
I have formulated a new reading strategy, and it is very simple: read 3 books and 3 audiobooks every month. Listening to 3 audiobooks a month is fairly easy - so I might even try to overshoot on that goal.

For reading, it is a little bit more of a stretch goal. Delivering on this goal means that every day I need to read 10% of a book. Often this is 20-30 pages. Some days this might not be possible, which means that more reading will need to happen on weekends as well as on flights and other forms of travel. The neat thing about the 3 books a month goal is that I can divide the month into three 10-day periods. On days 1-10 I need to finish the first book, on days 11-20 I need to finish the second book, and on days 21-30 I need to finish the third book. If a book is shorter, it is obviously advisable to try to finish it as quickly as possible so that you can get a headstart.
