# Stevens Open Innovation Hackathon
An interesting idea could be to arrange a hackathon where people hack on open innovation datasets: Github, thingiverse, IDEO open innovation contests, crowdfunding etc.

This would have the following benefits:
* Creating "seed" codes that could be used for data collection
* Sparking new research ideas
* Identifying high-performing students

Key would be to get administrative support, or probably even better, a student committee to run it.
