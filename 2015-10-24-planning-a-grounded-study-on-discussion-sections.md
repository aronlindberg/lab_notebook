# Planning a grounded study on discussion sections
Instead of just doing an informal research project, I should just do a formal research project on low intensity that can eventually be turned into an actual paper. Here's what I'll do:

* Starting from 2014 I'll go back in time and review all theory generating articles in ISR and MISQ. Theory generating articles are either pure theory, qualitative research, or inductive quantitative work. Analytical modeling is excluded, so is design science.
* I'll code all of these articles in Atlas.TI
* Then I'll try to elicit general "reflection moves" (which might have been the same if I had coded ASQ and AMJ), as well as artifact-related "reflection moves" which may be IS-specific.
* I should read from the end of findings to the very end of the article, but I think it's fine to focus on the theoretical implications.
