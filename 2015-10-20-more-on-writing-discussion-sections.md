# More on writing discussion sections
The writing of the discussion section today was rather smooth and flowing in terms of the quality of the experience. Part of the reason seems to have been the transitioning from a mode of strictly "articulating contributions" to discussing previous contributions, the current contribution, differences, similarities, and which of these differences represent extensions, i.e. new ways of seeing things.

I suspect that once I read this down the line it will be rather 'talky', but at this point I think it is OK. The talkiness is part of the theorizing process. We could think of this in terms of creative cognition (Fiske & Taylor) - the pre-inventive structures are previous contributions as well as the current contribution. I then engage in a process of recombination (Nickerson) or blending (Turner). This is where the 'talkiness' comes from - the comparing, contrasting, analogizing, metaphorizing, synthesizing (Harvey), which eventually identifies what is theoretically novel.

Hence, the theorizing process uses a number of intellectual materials: knowledge about past contributions, understanding of the current contribution, as well as conceptual insights into creative cognitions, and practical experiences of utilizing various creative cognitive moves (i.e. being able to connect an abstract definition of a cognitive move to an example or instantiation of said move).

The conclusion is: keep on coding discussion sections, reading substantive literature, as well as reading theorizing literature. This can then be distilled into a framework of creative cognitive moves with attendant examples.
