# Combining Theorizing & Networking
Based on Ann's feedback I'll no longer run the discussion coding "project" as a formal research project - it'll be a waste of time. Rather, what I will do is to read both front and backends (for now I'll start with the backends), and then I'll approach people that I know to talk about the details of how they constructed a certain discussion section. That would be a great way to understand a) the practice of bookending papers and b) understanding particular theoretical discourses. For example, it would be interesting to talk to:

* Howison about the OSS Way
* Pentland about routine complexity & artifacts/routines
* Ann about wiki lifecycles
* Zacharidias about retroduction

I think that'll be a good start. After that more papers and connections will follow.
