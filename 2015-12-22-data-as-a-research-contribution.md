# Data as a Research Contribution
Digital trace data is an important component of my overall research program. It is deceivingly easy to view digital trace data as being "publicly available". While this is true in a narrow sense, the actual research data that is needed to conduct an analysis, using a tool such as regression modeling, is generally not *readily* available. Rather, it needs to be extracted from publicly available digital traces. This often requires arduous processing, munging, and cleaning of the dataset to extract variables which can actually be used as input to standardized analytical tools.

Therefore, an important intermediary layer of work is necessary to transform publicly available digital trace data into readily available research data. This work is not trivial, requires substantial amounts of expertise and resources, and can, if done properly, be key for the accumulation of knowledge. Data repositories have grown and become prevalent within computational biology and ecology, and we argue that the same trend might be happening within the social sciences as well.

If a mechanism was available for standardized publishing and citing of data, and the interfaces to such data was easy enough to garner widespread usage, it could potentially lead to large amounts of citations, and therefore constitute an important research contribution. Indeed, the SBE directorate of the NSF has recently acknowledged this in a [dear colleague letter](http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14059/nsf14059.jsp).
