# Data as a Research Contribution
Digital trace data is an important component of my overall research program. It is deceivingly easy to view digital trace data as being "publicly available". While this is true in a narrow sense, the actual research data that is needed to conduct an analysis, using a tool such as regression modeling, is generally not *readily* available. Rather, it needs to be extracted from publicly available digital traces. This often requires arduous processing, munging, and cleaning of the dataset to extract variables which can actually be used as input to standardized analytical tools.

Therefore, an important intermediary layer of work is necessary to transform publicly available digital trace data into readily available research data. This work is not trivial, requires substantial amounts of expertise and resources, and can, if done properly, be key for the accumulation of knowledge. Data repositories have grown and become prevalent within computational biology and ecology, and we argue that the same trend might be happening within the social sciences as well.

If a mechanism was available for standardized publishing and citing of data, and the interfaces to such data was easy enough to garner widespread usage, it could potentially lead to large amounts of citations, and therefore constitute an important research contribution. Indeed, the SBE directorate of the NSF has recently acknowledged this in a [dear colleague letter](http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14059/nsf14059.jsp).

Further, this is not only about data per se, it's also about workflows, and reproducibility. If we want to be taken serious as an information- (data-) intensive science in our contemporary landscape we need to make sure there are standardized datasources as well as standardized ways of looking at those data sources. We should suggest that reproducibility is a fundamental validity criterion without which claims to validity cannot be trusted.

It is also not only the case for quantitative data. Textual data can easily be stored online, and markup tools can easily allow for rich tagging across a large body of text. Therefore qualitative researchers should also strive to contribute to these databases.

This could be written as a methods article, but it challenges the idea of a methods article as something that an individual researcher or research team can do - this is a community effort. Hence it is what we call a "community method". Another way to frame it is as a design science article - we are after all creating an artifact.

It could also concern itself with openness of data and workflows and make an overall argument with regards to what openness is, and how it would impact our field.
