# A Grounded Theory Study of Exploration and Exploitation in IS theorizing
With a better understanding of the papers, we may be able to more accurately capture the dimensions of theory development that actually leads to citations (or the potential for citations in case it is variance/skewness that is the interesting dependent variable and not the mean).

This would entail coding the theory development section of each paper, which I would probably define as stretching from the end of the introduction section to the beginning of the empirical study. Locke & Golden-Biddle coded from the first line of the abstract to the method section, which we might do to, so essentially we are focused on the same component of the text.

However, this is obviously a long-term project, and will take extensive amounts of time. But it would deliver extensive learning (and possibly insight into how people actually borrow, instantiate, modify, and extend theory)
