# On Text Mining

* Use stop-lists (getting rid of common, non-meaning bearing words)
* Stemming (getting rid of non-informational prefixes and suffixes)
* Lemmatization (getting rid of inflections)
* Topic modeling can be done using just word-co-occurences, using hierarchical agglomerative clustering
* Latent semantic analysis seems to offer the best opportunities for getting to fine-grained concepts, given that we are able to identify good dictionaries.
* Some dictionaries:
  - DICTION - Hart
  - Lasswell Value Dictionary - Lasswell
  - GEneral Inquirer Harvard IV - Stone
  - Communication Vagueness Dictionary - Hiller
  - Brand Personality Dictionary - Opoku
  - Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) - Pennebaker
  - Regressive Imagery Dictionary (RID) - Martindale
