# A research program is crystallizing
I think that my research program around creativity, design, and innovation is becoming more and more clear in it's outlines. The method is computational-qualitative, the focus is on innovation processes (broadly defined as requirements/creativity/innovation/development, even stretching a bit into development), with a special interest in the design of emergent phenomena and complex adaptive systems. This latter concern reflects a growing trend in information systems where we increasingly do not design static systems (e.g. ERP systems) which can be thrust upon a captive workforce. Rather, we increasingly design platforms and ecosystems which rely on preferential attachment and network effects out of which emergent behavior arises. Theoretically I am focused on temporality, routines, emergence, complex adaptive systems, distributed cognition, and information processing.

I think of my research program as a cluster of research objects under development. Research objects are bundles of theories & arguments, data, analytical techniques, evidence, and stories tying the previously mentioned objects together. Key to the functioning of the research program is, on the one hand, integration around emergent innovation processes and computational-qualitative data & methods. On the other hand I achieve differentiation through a comprehensive coverage of empirical studies, theoretical exposition, methods, and field-level arguments.

A key to unifying this program is to make sure to maintain a constant focus on performance, innovation, and creativity as dependent variables. This allows me to build a cumulative body of knowledge that can bring practical value to various stakeholders.

* **Empirics:** open innovation/creativity/design, complexity, routines, temporality, distributed cognition, action nets, ambidexterity
* **Methods:** computational narrativism
* **Data:** oss database, data as a research contribution
* **Field-level arguments:** exploration/exploitation

The core of the research program is a set of research papers, supported by grant applications, focused reading, technical skill development, and a living, breathing research wiki.
