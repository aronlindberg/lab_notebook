# Algorithmic agents as Actor-Networks
These actor-networks, in the context of wonga.com, seem to consist of the following components:
* Direct information (entered by an applicant)
* Semi-direct information (provided by applicant through connecting to Facebook and other forms of public or semi-public information)
* Indirect information (general risk statistics that algorithms use to make assessments, such as that which Credit Reference agencies provide)
* Algorithms (software running on wonga.com's servers)...Tom says that these are determininistic - so how can we call the whole system an algorithmic agent.
* Human decision-makers in tricky situations ('referral').
* Stored results (results of previous runs of algorithms that serve to prime and train future runs of algorithms)
* Hardware(the actual hardware that runs the algorithms)
* Customers (those who enter the direct information)
* People-in-general (those who supply semi-direct and indirect information)
* Designers those who design the algorithms and selects the information sources upon which they operate
* Decisions (binary and/or rate decisions made by algorithms)
* Legal constraints
* Banking infrastructure for receiving and repaying loans automatically
* Conflict resolution agents (humans over phone for resolving)
