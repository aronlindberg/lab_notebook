# Computational Field Research

If I set the framework for a literature review, then the students can work on reviewing all the literature, categorize it, and test it conceptually against certain questions which I define. That would set the stage for formulating a research framework, which can make a contribution through outlining a) insights which are only possible with the new approach, and b) showing ways to conduct research that is likely to yield such insights.

A number of questions which would be interesting for the students to consider:
* What research exists out there that is quantitative and inductive?
* What are the consequences of the dual nature of digital trace data (it being both qualitative and quantitative)?
* What makes "computational field research" different from "computational social science", "big data Grounded Theory Method", or just econometrics using digital trace data?
* What questions can be answered by computational field research methods that could not be answered by purely qualitative research methods?
* How would wholly inductive quantitative studies look?
* What research designs are possible, considering different ways of combining qualitative data:
    - Explaining correlations using qualitative data
    - Validating qualitative observations using digital traces
    - Validating the substantive meaning of quantified digital traces (using qualitative data)
* Can computational field research show latent patterns which either intensive qualitative studies or high-level econometric studies could not have uncovered?
* Can the predictive, black-boxing, nature of machine learning be coupled with qualitative insight to generate strong theory out of predictive quantitative work?

Two particular ideas which may be interesting to explore are "generalizable analysis of actor-networks" and "computational narrativism". The former would be an article in a similar format to Gaskin's (2014) article on sociomaterial routines. Here we could draw on Hodder (2012) and create a taxonomy for sociomaterial networks and then show how we can analyze these quantitatively. This would be somewhat similar to Contractor et al (2011), so we would have to define what the contribution is relative to that article (and similar work).

The latter would be more of an extension of the work that I have been doing and would look at how we can use various process/sequence mining techniques in concert with text mining and tracing of associated longitudinal patterns as ways of formulating computationally based process theories.
