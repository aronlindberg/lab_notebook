# Computational Field Research

If I set the framework for a literature review, then the students can work on reviewing all the literature, categorize it, and test it conceptually against certain questions which I define. That would set the stage for formulating a research framework, which can make a contribution through outlining a) insights which are only possible with the new approach, and b) showing ways to conduct research that is likely to yield such insights.

A number of questions which would be interesting for the students to consider:
* What research exists out there that is quantitative and inductive?
* What are the consequences of the dual nature of digital trace data (it being both qualitative and quantitative)?
* What makes "computational field research" different from "computational social science", "big data Grounded Theory Method", or just econometrics using digital trace data?
* What questions can be answered by computational field research methods that could not be answered by purely qualitative research methods?
* How would wholly inductive quantitative studies look?
* What research designs are possible, considering different ways of combining qualitative data:
    - Explaining correlations using qualitative data
    - Validating qualitative observations using digital traces
    - Validating the substantive meaning of quantified digital traces (using qualitative data)
* Can computational field research show latent patterns which either intensive qualitative studies or high-level econometric studies could not have uncovered?
* Can the predictive, black-boxing, nature of machine learning be coupled with qualitative insight to generate strong theory out of predictive quantitative work?
