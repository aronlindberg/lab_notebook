# The role of complexity in OSS
Having implemented file-interdependence graphs as well as Pentland's measure of routine complexity, it now seems as if I have stronger evidence for...something. The story has changed, which I think is fine. The patterns are actually more clear and reliable now, so I think we are getting closed to actually telling the story of what is happening.

The most clear pattern is still that entropy leads to the merging of code. Complexity has the opposite effect, the higher the complexity the lower the degree of code merging. However, we can show through our qualitative coding that these higher degrees of routine complexity is related to concerns outside of the code - essentially social complexity related to conflicting mental models, local system configurations, and similar factors.

As such community-related complexity increases the chances of merging decrease, however - other outcomes are generated such as learning, which can be potentially useful for future routine enactments. Also, the complexity can be argued to be necessary to counter these types of community-related complexity, so that relatively entropic routine enactments can be used to actually merge code. In this sense, the complex routines play the role of separating the wheat from the chaff - essentially evaluating which problems actually can be solved, and which are too complex, or possibly should not be solved (at least now in the format proposed in a particular pull request).
