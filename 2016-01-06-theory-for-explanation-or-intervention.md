# Theory for Explanation or Intervention
* Since we are not consultants, activists, or journalists - therefore we should focus on creating and validating good theory
* In my mind, it would still be useful for theory to be practical, so that consultants, activists, or journalists can use it (or at least some popularized version published in textbooks or an HBR-type article)
* Are action research and design science valid forms of research? I guess so. Perhaps they are sufficient as specialized forms of research.
* Is there really a dichotomy between explanatory and interventionist research?
* Saying that research needs to have an impact and/or practical relevance does not necessarily imply that we have to be action researchers. Lars Matthiassen suggests that Van de Ven's term "engaged scholarship" can be helpful to resolve this practical dichotomy.
