# DeLanda - Philosophy & Simulation: The Emergence of Synthetic Reason
> pp. 135-136: "The behavior of both agents and resources was entirely determined by rules and was therefore not emergent, but the use of rules is an advantage in this case because if the actions of the agents had been produced by a neural net it would be hard not to view those actions as implying personal agency. With rules, on the other hand, no assumption about underlying mechanisms is made so agency can be attributed to larger units, like entire households or communities."

If the behavior of a system is determined by rules, then it's behavior cannot be emergent. However, the actions of individual agents in an agent-based model is determined by rules, and it is the interaction of agents that creates emergent patterns. However, if an agents behavior is determined by rules, can it be said to be agentic - not really. What DeLanda might be getting at here is that a neural network does not allow for a deterministic response to a given stimuli. Rather, a neural network demands that we think in terms of structural coupling - stimuli is massaged through the neural network and leads to a response that is determined not only by the stimuli, but also by the internal, dynamic structure of the neural network. Hence, a neural network can imply agency.
