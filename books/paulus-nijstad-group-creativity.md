# Paulus & Nijstad - Group Creativity: Innovation Through Collaboration

On p. 34 (chapter 2 on the links between group diversity and creativity) they discuss the links between group configurations, divergent thinking, and creativity. I'm immediately thinking that a potential argument to be made is for different kinds of process diversity. This would entail evaluating the different forms of process diversity, explicate their meanings, and then show which effects that they have. Based on the results that we have, this would then culminate in showing how entropy only matters in the extreme (i.e. above the 75% quantile), how task complexity measures based on single transitions do not matter, but how subsequence-based measures such as turbulence do matter. This would then draw primarily on the literatures of diversity and creativity, and then show completely new forms of diversity. Additionally, we could also add the Optimal Matching distances, and hypothesize that creative sequences should be less standardized, which is also supported by the findings. We can link this to the literature on organizational routines as well, since many of these measures come from this literature.

P. 36: noting that laboratory research on brainstorming generate less creative ideas. This implies that the social interdependence in the group or the group interaction decreases the variance and homogenizes thinking.
