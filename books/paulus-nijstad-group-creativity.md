# Paulus & Nijstad - Group Creativity: Innovation Through Collaboration
On p. 34 (chapter 2 on the links between group diversity and creativity) they discuss the links between group configurations, divergent thinking, and creativity. I'm immediately thinking that a potential argument to be made is for different kinds of process diversity. This would entail evaluating the different forms of process diversity, explicate their meanings, and then show which effects that they have. Based on the results that we have, this would then culminate in showing how entropy only matters in the extreme (i.e. above the 75% quantile), how task complexity measures based on single transitions do not matter, but how subsequence-based measures such as turbulence do matter. This would then draw primarily on the literatures of diversity and creativity, and then show completely new forms of diversity. Additionally, we could also add the Optimal Matching distances, and hypothesize that creative sequences should be less standardized, which is also supported by the findings. We can link this to the literature on organizational routines as well, since many of these measures come from this literature.

p. 36: noting that laboratory research on brainstorming generate less creative ideas. This implies that the social interdependence in the group or the group interaction decreases the variance and homogenizes thinking.

Many of the passages concern diversity of characteristics in groups, but they do not seem to focus specifically on the various forms of diversity or variance of processes or procedural characteristics. This is a potential opportunity for us to contribute. Here we could decompose variety of processes in a number of characteristics:

* Entropy
* Range of activity types
* Transitions
* Transition-based complexity (e.g. Haerem & Pentland)
* Turbulence in activity durations (rhythm or variance in activity durations)
* Subsequences

  p. 67: "Such a phenomenon [polarization] helps to explain why homogeneity coupled with high levels of interaction and intolerance of dissent are successful in maintaining and even exacerbating the beliefs held in corporate culture of cults."

This would seem to be a major inhibitor of creativity, innovation, and heterogeneity in general. The desire of individuals to be part of a group. This seems to also be related to what I learned when reading about T-groups and psychoanalysis together with Ron Fry: that human beings are constantly caught in a tension between freedom and belonging - we all want to be free agents and individually unique, at the same time as we want to be part of a group, with the homogenizing effects that the latter entails. Similarly, the [Asch conformity experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments) showed that the human need to conform to the opinion of the majority is so strong that we will often deny basic sensory perceptions to align our assessments to that of a majority.

p. 101: Whenever they talk about process (even when they use the term procedures), they seem to be talking about substantive rational evaluation of outcomes of processes, as opposed to actual procedural rationality with regards to the specific sequenced action steps taken to generate a certain outcome.

  p. 213: "One consequence of team development is increased cohesion among members...In addition, cohesion increases conformity to team norms (Festinger, Scachter, & Back, 1950) and punishment of those who deviate from these norms (Schachter, 1950). It would not be surprising, then, if members of cohesive teams tended to resist innovation efforts on the part of newcomers (cf. Brawley, Carron, & Widmeyer, 1988; Mills 1957)"

Here again we see the homogenizing effect of social interdependence (which must be related to cohesion since cohesion cannot be achieved without dense social relationships).

  p. 247: "Dimensions for classifying group task characteristics include task difficulty, solution multiplicity, intrinsic interest, cooperative requirements (Shaw, 1976), unitary versus divisible, conjunctive, disjunctive, and additive (Steiner, 1972), conflict versus cooperation, and conceptual versus behavioral (McGrath, 1984). These classification systems have been developed from within the experimental and social psychology tradition and have not been adopted by researchers exploring group performance and innovation in organizational settings...Such classifications therefore have limited utility in real-life settings. A more useful alternative is action theory (Frese  &Zapf, 1994; Hacker, 1986; Tschan & von Cranach, 1996; Volpert, 1984), which describes tasks in relation to their hierarchical, sequential, and cyclical process requirements"

All of these different forms of tasks may be moderators in e.g. OSS development or crowdsourcing ideas - meaning that different types of sequentially structured processes may be effective given the type of task the group is tasked with. Especially modeling the task according to action theory may help to establish tighter and more obvious theoretical linkages between task and execution process.

  p. 254: "However, tenure homogeneity has been positively related in some studies to frequency of communication, social integration within the group, and innovation (O'Reilly & Flatt, 1989). This may be because the longer people work together, the more they create a predictable and therefore safer social psychological environment. Such safety may enable the exploration and risk taking necessary for innovation (Edmondson, 1996)."

This seems to support the opposite argument - that social interdependence leads to heterogeneity and creativity. Social interdependence may also bring together divergent ideas (at least if the flow of newcomers is large and constant, like it is in OSS), which also may engender creativity.

  p. 257: "There is support for the notion that high centralization is a negative predictor of innovation (Burns & Stalkerm 1961; Hage & Aiken, 1967; Shepard, 1967)...However, our research in manufacturing organizations (West, Patterson, Pillinger, & Nickel, 2000) also suggests that centralization may also be necessary to ensure innovation implementation. Zaltman et al. calls this the innovation dilemma...The longer human social organization endure, the more embedded become their norms and the more resilient to change become their traditions."

This "innovation dilemma" (seemingly distinct from Christensen's dilemma) could be what I'm looking for - that interdependence has both homogeneizing and heterogenizing effects.

  p. 281: "According to the framework, the three basic elements of organizations are members, tools, and tasks...The task-task network is the sequence of tasks or routines employed in the organization"

There may be opportunities to use a graph representation of routines to do more than simply extract a measure of complexity. Various other descriptive graph statistics could be extracted and interpreted. It would be useful to see if there are any statistics which are commonly used with Directed Acyclic Graphs, such as the git commit tree.

  p. 288 "...homogeneous organizations learned or benefited more from their experience than heterogeneous organizations" because of the greater opportunities for effective communication in an homogenous community.

However, such learning may be exploitative rather than explorative. It could be that homogeneous communities learn to perform stabilized routines more effectively over time, but that doesn't mean that their learning is diverse or performs any explorative tasks at all.

  p. 289: "Significant changes in the rate of output have generally been found to hinder group and organizational performance (Perston & Keachie, 1964)."

This seems to be a persistent theme - our HMM results of OSS projects seem to indicate that high rates of HMM change hinders performance. Klarner & Raisch found that frequent changes in strategic direction decreased performance, etc.

  p. 292: "Tasks that are well understood transfer more readily [between units] than tasks that are high in "causal ambiguity" (Szulanski, 1996)."

I've been trying to track down the cite for "causal ambiguity" for a while now:

  > Szulanski, G. (1996). *Exploring Internal Stickiness: Impediments to the Transfer of Best Practice Within the Firm*. Strategic Management Journal, 17(2), 27–43.

  Szulanski, G., & Jensen, R. J. (2006). *Presumtive Adaptation and the Effectiveness of Knowledge Transfer*. Strategic Management Journal, 957(February), 937–957.

  pp. 316-318: "Across four major world civilizations--European, Islamic, Hindu, and Chinese--the aggregate level of cultural creativity was positively correlated with the number of independent states...political fragmentation provides a positive environment for the emergence of ideological diversity...Fourth, when civilizations open themselves up to the influx of alien ideas--via immigration, foreign travel, or study under foreign masters--they tend to experience a resurgence of creative activity (Simonton, 1997b)."

Again, this seems to indicate that social modularization should lead to creativity and heterogeneity. However, does this take into account boundary spanners across structural holes (Burt)? Perhaps the immigrants and foreign students are the boundary spanners here?

  p. 337: "Unfortunately, very little attnetion has been devoted to the effects of different kinds of tasks on group creativity."

Let the search for moderators begin!
