# Swedberg - Theorizing in Social Science
> p. 61: "Analogical reasoning is the cognitive process of structural alignment and mapping between separate, distinctive domains and their parts (Gentner 1983). It is a complex process that we experience in a flash of recognition."

This is interesting, because it establishes the link between theorizing and creativity. On a personal level it seems as if creativity in theorizing would increase the larger the knowledge one has about potentially structurally equivalent domains relative to the phenomena under study. Combining qualitative and computational research, drawing on digital humanities, and design studies is naturally helpful here. However, I think it would also be helpful to expand my reading of classical literature, especially that which is concerned with social concerns: classic science fiction, Palahniuk, Vonnegut (.e.g Player Piano), Asimov, Orwell, Solzhenitsyn, J.D. Salinger, Steinbeck, Harper Lee (To Kill a Mockingbird), Shakespeare, Sinclair (Oil!), Pamuk etc. There seems to be some good ideas [here](http://www.nytimes.com/library/books/072098best-novels-list.html), [here](http://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/sociological-fiction), [here](https://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2009/10/08/using-works-of-fiction-in-sociology-courses/), and [here](https://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2008/04/10/organization-theory-in-novels/).

> p. 87 "Instead, we maintain that individual psychological processes of discovery or serendipity intersect in complex ways with communities of scientific inquiry."

That is, in order for a process of discovery to not only uncover "news to you", but also something that is useful for a community, the creative process needs to be put in relation to what is already known (or what is already common practice).

> p. 165: "In a classic experiment on hindisght bias, Fischhoff (1975) told random participants about the Indian battles between the Gurkhas and the British. One set of participants was told that the Gurkhas had won, another that the British had won, and a third set was told nothing about the outcome. The Participants who thought they were informed about the correct outcome were not only convinced that "their" outcome was more plausible; they also stated that they knew the (false) outcome even before participating in the experiment - an effect that Fischhoff calls "creeping determinism (Fiscchhof 1975: 297)."

Hence, it seems to us as if the way things developed historically was the only natural way, and we do not necessarily see the actual turn of events as surprising or unlikely. Therefore, it is important to try to find breakdowns (because they illustrate necessary and/or sufficient conditions for a specific outcome). Similarly, trying to imagine how things could have been otherwise can be a helpful thought experiment for understanding causal processes.

> p. 182: "The Mexican Sierra has 17 plus 15 plus 9 spines in the dorsal fin. These can easily be counted. But if the sierra strikes hard on the line so that our hands are burned, if the fish sounds and nearly escapes and finally comes in over the rail, his colors pulsing and his tail beating the air, a whole new relational externality has come into being - an entity which is more than the sum of the fish plus the fisherman"

Weick uses this story to illustrate the tension between the orderly ways in which we "understand backward" and the chaotic and improvised ways in which we "live forward".

> p. 184: "Although "substituting" is an apt general description of what theorists do when they theorize, the artist Robert Irwin provides a more detailed description of the changes that are involved in substituting. He suggests that the changes involve six stages: perception, conception, form, formful, formal, and formalized. The progression "is not so much temporal progression as a phenomenological one...""

Again, the links between creativity and theorizing are highlighted here. This also suggests that reading accounts of the creative processes of artists, software designers, and architects will be helpful in understanding theorizing better.

> p. 187: "The basic notion is that "human actions are initiated by nothing other than the idea of the sensory consequences that typically result from them " (Stock and Stock 2004: 176)"

This mirrors what Hawkins says in "On Intelligence", that action essentially is a result of prediction. I.e. we predict what is going to happen as we move our hand, and the hand movement is a result of that prediction.

> p. 196: "The contradiction between understanding and interpretation has a distinguished history. One of the more persistent themes of intellect is the creative antithesis between the causal description of existence and the mystery of its interpretation. It fills our philosophy: Kierkegaard, Hegel, Kant. It fills our poetry: Wordsworth, Goethe, Neruda. It fills our science: Da Vinci, Darwin, Marx. It fills our prose: Dostoyevsky, Vesaas, Fontane."

This is indeed an important duality, but it is not necessarily one that is defined in terms of quantitative or qualitative analysis methods.
